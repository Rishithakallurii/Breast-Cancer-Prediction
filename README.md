# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

# Overview
Breast cancer is a serious condition where cells in the breast grow uncontrollably, forming tumors that can potentially spread to other parts of the body if left untreated. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This project aims to predict the likelihood of breast cancer using machine learning techniques to help in early diagnosis and treatment.

#Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a prediction model for breast cancer classification using various machine learning algorithms. The model analyzes patient data to determine whether a patient is likely to have breast cancer. We compare the performance of multiple algorithms and present the results of our ensemble model.

#Data & dataset
The model uses raw medical data from patient records. The data is preprocessed and then fed into the machine learning algorithms for training and prediction.

#Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved a prediction accuracy of 99.35%. Detailed results and model performance metrics can be found in the notebook
